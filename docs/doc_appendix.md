## Metric Definitions

This section details all the metrics calculated by Ultralyzer, organized by category.

Pixel coordinates start at the top-left corner of the image (0,0). X increases to the right, and Y increases downwards. Therefore, a coordinate `(x, y)` refers to a point `x` pixels to the right and `y` pixels down from the top-left corner.
